# ImageTaggingAndDenseAnnotation (In progress...!!!)
Before Diving deep into Dense Annotation, Let me go through Mask RCNN 


###### This project is under progress
The project cites to the following papers on paper directory.
And cites following repo
1. SSD: Single-Shot MultiBox Detector
2. Mask R-CNN for Object Detection and Segmentation 
  
  * Instance Segmentation i.e object Detection and Semantic Segmentation  
  - uses Faster Region Convolution Neural Network (FCNN) and Fully Connected Network (FCN) 

###### Real Time (Video) tagging with Mask-RCNN 
However frame rate is too low. Requires improvement on the algorithm, also my machine doesn't have an GPU
